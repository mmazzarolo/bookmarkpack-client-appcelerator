# BookmarkPack Client appcelerator

An Appcelerator Android app that I've been using for testing the [BookmarkPack server](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/bookmarkpack-server) API while also improving my (low) Appcelerator skills.

The user can login with an account that can be obtained from [this Angular test app](http://bookmarkpack.herokuapp.com/#/) and see its bookmarks.
